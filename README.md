HR-SNA
======

Here is a research of Social Network Analysis in HR management and it holds an ultimate outlook that we can structure or quantify jobs or positions in an organization by introducing Social Network Analysis and computing algorithm into the field. (Hypothesis is that similar positions share a similar communication or interaction pattern, by using Social Network Analysis, we can computing those characteristic vectors of interaction pattern of each position and have cluster analysis on those positions further.)
